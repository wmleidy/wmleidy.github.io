		<p>I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, a small city which recently retained its crown as America’s most obese. From my earliest childhood I was encouraged by my parents, an endocrinologist and a special ed teacher, to explore all of my interests. Like most kids, these included things like baseball, video games, and outer space. Unlike most kids, these also included reading novels and, above all, doing math. Among my classmates and teachers, I swiftly gained the reputation of “the kid who likes math maybe a little bit too much.” In retrospect, the glasses, braces, deplorable fashion sense, and, once puberty hit, the acne only served to reinforce this image.</p>

		<p>When I left home to attend the University of Rochester, blissfully unaware that the four straight months of lake effect snow that Rochester experiences each year would put a serious damper on social life there, I fully intended to become a chemical engineer. However, during my sophomore year fate&mdash;and Dostoevsky&mdash;would intervene. I had questions about life, the world, and human culture which my organic chemistry classes just weren’t able to provide sufficient answers to. Though I continued taking chemistry classes (eventually “dropping the E,” i.e. the “engineering”), more and more Russian classes started to appear in my course schedule, until eventually there were enough for me to double major. And by the spring of senior year, partly buoyed by the creative thrill of writing for the <em>Onion</em>-esque satirical newspaper I founded, I knew that my interest in Russian literature and culture had eclipsed my interest in chemistry.</p>
		
		<p>So, I went to Moscow for a year, where I built my language chops in preparation for grad school, learned quite a bit about culture (both Russian culture and, through the principle of comparison, our own), took the photograph that graces the top of this page, and somehow managed to avoid paying a bribe to the Russian police despite possessing the twin handicaps of being American and looking like “a person of Caucasian nationality.”</p>

		<p>Attending Stanford University for grad school was truly a blessing for me. The Slavic faculty there is top notch and the institutional support unparalleled. Thanks to generous travel grants, I gained professional fluency in both Russian and Polish, while the professoriate nurtured my ability to think analytically, to teach what I know to others, and to write in really long sentences like these that don’t really work on the Internet. I also put three-plus years of Churchillian blood, toil, tears, and sweat into a very good dissertation (if I do say so myself) on scandal and literature that maybe five to ten people will ever bother reading a portion of, that is, if I’m lucky. But such is the life of a typical academic, especially those in the humanities.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the best part of my Stanford experience was being a part of the community of brilliant scholars and grad student colleagues, which was a continuous source of inspiration and thought-provoking dialogue. Many of my closest friends from Stanford still live in the Bay Area and work in the tech industry&mdash;some at the biggest names in Silicon Valley, and others at successful start-ups. So, I think it was only natural after treading water for the two years following the conferral of my PhD, during which time I supported myself through a combination of adjunct positions and freelance translation and tutoring gigs, that my career thoughts would turn toward the innovative, fast-moving, and massively influential tech industry. I don’t know exactly where I’ll find my niche, but thanks to my love of learning languages, I think web development represents as good of an entrée into the industry as any.</p>

		<p>When I’m not writing code or writing words in an overly loquacious manner, my hobbies these days include playing and watching soccer, going to concerts (jazz, art rock, metal, you name it), trying to coax not-quite-awful sounds out of my guitar, hiking, traveling (because where can one hike in the Chicagoland area?), cooking, and taking pictures of stuff.</p>
