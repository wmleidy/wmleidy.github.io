		<h3>In Brief</h3>
		<p>Over the course of my life, I have lived in many cities and have had a wide variety of intellectual interests. I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia with childhood dreams of becoming a mathematician, before going to away to college in Rochester, New York, where fate and a budding interest in writing and human culture led me to double major in physical chemistry and Russian. I decided to further pursue my interest in the latter, which led me to live in Moscow, Russia for a year in preparation for enrollment in the PhD program in Slavic Languages and Literatures at Stanford University.</p>

		<p>During my time at Stanford, thanks to generous scholarships and travel grants to Eastern Europe, I gained professional fluency in both Russian and Polish, while the professoriate nurtured my ability to think analytically, to teach what I know to others, and to write in really long sentences like these that don’t really work on the Internet. I also put 3+ years of Churchillian blood, toil, tears, and sweat into a fun dissertation on scandal and literature.</p>

		<p>During the two years following the conferral of my PhD, I supported myself through a combination of adjunct positions and freelance translation and tutoring gigs, before deciding to set off on a new journey and immerse myself in the world of web development.</p>

		<h3>Some Thoughts on Language</h3>
		<p>The transition from natural languages to programming languages has been an interesting one for me. On the one hand, Russian and Polish contain tens of thousands of words, an extensive case system, and complicated syntax. The sheer size of a human language and its rules (and exceptions to the rules) dwarfs any programming language. Furthermore, natural languages exist inside a big messy framework called “culture” where, as groundbreaking 20th-century philosophers have pointed out, every utterance is intimately interconnected with both past and future utterances. The scale is unthinkably immense.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, programming languages present their own challenges&mdash;getting from here to there efficiently often requires excellent logical and mathematical skills, while the task of modeling real-world objects within a programming language in a maximally effective manner requires a type of creativity very different than the one poets or authors exercise. In my mind, the thing that links together natural and programming languages is that they’re both incredibly fun to work with.</p>

		<h3>Trivia</h3>
		<p>When I’m not writing code concisely or writing words loquaciously, my hobbies these days include playing and watching soccer, going to concerts (jazz, art rock, metal, you name it), trying to coax not-quite-awful sounds out of my guitar, hiking, traveling (because where can one hike in the Chicagoland area?), cooking, and taking pictures of stuff, including the 15th-century walls of medieval Russian fortresses as seen at the top of the desktop version of this page.</p>
