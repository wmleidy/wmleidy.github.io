  			<p>While in the middle of contemplating what I should write aboout for this particular post about issues with technology and the tech industry, I visited the New York Times and discovered that they had already done a lot of the work for me. Included in their list of feature stories on July 11 was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html?_r=0">an article about the resignation of Ellen Pao from Reddit</a>, which contained the quote, “[Pao] was particularly subject to the abuse stemming from the pockets of toxic misogyny in the Reddit ecosystem” (one could probably replace “Reddit” with “Silicon Valley” without batting an eye), a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/style/a-eulogy-for-the-long-intimate-email.html">“eulogy” for the long, intimate email</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/sunday-review/addicted-to-your-phone-theres-help-for-that.html">a self-help guide for overcoming smartphone addiction</a>.</p>

  			<p>The persistence of gender-based workplace discrimination, shifts in cultural norms caused by the proliferation of technology, and the crippling need to constantly check one’s phone are three very important tech-related issues. But these aren’t the only ones.</p>

  			<h2>Tech Issues: A List</h2>

  			<p>Lists seem to be pretty popular content-delivery systems on the web (all the more so when the list items are spread over multiple pages in order to increase ad revenue). Rather than fully analyzing any one the issues mentioned above in this post, I’d like to instead provide a list-based overview of my thoughts on problems facing the tech industry as well as the cultural disruptions caused by technology and big data, while reserving the right to delve deeper into these issues in a later piece.</p>

  			<h4>The Industry</h4>
  			
  			<p>1. <strong>Messianism</strong> &ndash; Of all the things that Mike Judge subjects to his satirical eye in the HBO series Silicon Valley, I think the thing he deconstructs most incisively is the idea of tech messianism that pervades the Bay Area. Whether the company is big (such as Gavin Belson’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQO5oqrP1KE">Hooli</a>) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXuFrtmOYKg">small</a>), it is vital that its technology will “make the world a better place.” The bigger the company, the more grandiose the proclamation must be. In actual fact, the overwhelming majority of products generally do one or two things: make some minute aspect of human existence incrementally more efficient and/or create new methods for gathering information about its users, which can then be sold along to other companies for marketing purposes or potentially used for more sinister means in countries with authoritarian systems.</p>
  			
  			<p>For example, while the Arab Spring was unfolding in 2011, journalists, academics, and tech activists were falling over themselves to be the first to proclaim how Twitter had revolutionized how revolutions happen. Ours would be the age of openness, the age of political accountability all thanks to the increased ease of connecting with others through electronic means and organizing resistance. But mass protests and revolutions had occurred before 2011. And while Facebook and Twitter might have made it slightly easier for like-minded people to come together to protest, the presence of a permanent electronic record of discontent that’s traceable to one’s device through telecomm records and the like has the potential to be highly problematic for the more vociferous protesters down the road.</p>

  			<p>2. <strong>Diversity</strong> &ndash; It’s an open secret that the tech industry and the surrounding ecosystem of venture capitalist firms are predominantly male and overrepresented by non-Hispanic whites and Asians. The root cause should perhaps be traced back to the varying achievement levels in the STEM disciplines that is seen across the many levels of the American educational system, whose own root cause is attributable to how math and science are taught in the US and certain ingrained stereotypes. The preponderance of males in the tech industry has quite organically led to the evolution of a certain institutional culture in which not everyone feels equally welcome.</p>

  			<h4>Culture and Technology</h4>
  			<p>3. <strong>Tech Addiction</strong> &ndash; I was at ground zero for the smartphone revolution, which, believe or not, started only eight years ago in June 2007. I remember observing over the following months and years how my Bay Area friends, especially the iPhone earlier adopters, became less and less able to hold a conversation, watch a television show, or make a factual claim without pulling their phone out of their pocket every couple minutes or so. By 2015, this phone-dependence affects seemingly every American younger than 40, myself included, of course. I could be mistaken, but I think the only time people try to consciously refrain from constantly looking at their phones is when they’re on a first, second, or maybe third date with someone. After all, we want to at least project that we’re giving our undivided attention (although in the back of our minds, we very well might be thinking about our phones and all the content we’re missing out on).</p>

  			<p>Lest I come across as a tech-skeptic, let me make clear that I very much enjoy having the full power of the Internet and my entire music library at my fingertips at all times. But as with almost any positive phenomenon, there are also hidden costs. </p>
  			communication/alienation (character limits, death of long email, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/nyregion/on-tinder-taking-a-swipe-at-love-or-sex-or-something-in-new-york.html">blockquote from Tinder article nytimes</a>)
  			4. dependency / addiction (early dates only time we don't constantly look at phones)
  			5. attention span (bombarded by stimuli, "But smartphones are a potent delivery mechanism for two fundamental human impulses, according to Paul Atchley, a psychology professor at the University of Kansas: our quest to find new and interesting distractions, and our desire to feel that we have checked off a task.")

  			<h4>Big Data</h4>
  			6. confusion of veracity of info (if it's on Wikipedia it's gospel, like a long reduce method gone wrong, elides over alternative narratives, hides power)
  			7. privacy/invasive (NSA, Mac becoming the very thing it rebelled against, invasive apps that have an insatiable thirst for all your data for ad-selling purposes)
