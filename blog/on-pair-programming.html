  			<h1>Pair Programming: Initial Impressions</h1>
				<p class="date">July 17, 2015</p>

			<p>One of the cornerstones of Dev Bootcamp’s educational philosophy is the extensive use of pair programming. Pair programming, a technique that falls under the umbrella of <a html="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development</a>, has been gaining considerable popularity in the tech industry. Instead of one programmer sitting silently in his cubicle sporadically working on the task that has assigned to him, pair programming involves two programmers sitting next to each other (or connecting remotely), looking at the same screen, and completing the task together. There are two roles in a pair programming team&mdash;a driver, who grabs the reins and writes the code, and the navigator, who reviews the code as it is being written, questions dubious design decisions, and proposes improvements or alternative pathways. Pair programming is predicated, of course, on the principle of “two heads are better than one,” as my grandfather would say.</p>

			<p>As of the time of writing, I have participated in exactly one dozen pair programming sessions. I would categorize each and every one of them as a positive experience; however, this is not to say that each experience has been similar. On the contrary, my experiences have varied considerably.</p>

			<p>The one thing I’ve enjoyed the most about the pair programming sessions has been the social aspect. Not only have they offered a pleasant break from the occasional monotony of solo work, but they have also allowed me to get to know the fellow students in my Dev Bootcamp cohort. I’ve worked together with some very talented and interesting people from all three Dev Bootcamp locations (SF, NYC, and Chicago)&mdash;sometimes at the end of a session I feel a small pang of regret that I won’t have the opportunity to work with the person during the on-site portion of the program.</p>

			<p>Another uneqivocally positive thing that has happened a couple times is ending up with code that is more elegant, more reusable, and more “optimized” than the code I would have written if I had done the task by myself. I imagine this often occurs in a professional environment when both programmers are experienced hands and bring different backgrounds and strengths to the project.</p>

			<p>The one part I have been less enamored about the pair programming experience is perhaps an inevitability for a program like Dev Bootcamp where students enter with diverse backgrounds and differing levels of prior programming knowledge. As I spent five months prior to enrolling in Dev Bootcamp teaching myself the basics of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby in order to help me decide whether this was a career path I really wanted to pursue, I feel that I’ve been in the position of the “senior” programmer (relatively speaking, of course!) for many of the pairings. Just like psychology, this is a knife that can cut both ways. On the one hand, it gives me the opportunity to flex my teaching muscles and check whether I deeply comprehend the concepts involved. On the other hand, to cite a cliché I often heard back when I played tennis, “you can only truly get better when you play with someone better than you.” Actually, this is probably more a reflection on Dev Bootcamp’s Phase 0 curriculum than the skill level of my programming partners, but nonetheless there is a vague feeling of frustration that I haven’t been challenged more over these first five weeks.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, though, it is good for my professional development to know what it feels like to be on both sides of senior/junior spectrum while pair programming. Lord knows that I’ll usually be the junior side of things during the first years of my career, and being cognizant of the senior programmer’s mindset will help me understand where I can contribute to a project, while also maximizing the growth rate of my skills.</p>
