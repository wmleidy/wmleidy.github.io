      <h1>Object-Oriented Game Programming (Advent of Code, Day 21)</h1>

    <p>My fourth and final post in my <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> series is devoted to two topics that I very much enjoy writing about: games and <a href="my-introduction-to-object-oriented-design.html">object-oriented programming</a>. As Advent of Code progressed and the challenges became more complex, there was a definite tipping point (at least in my mind) when taking advantage of Ruby’s classes to program in an object-oriented fashion paid dividends both in terms of quickly finding a valid solution and in terms of code readability.</p>

    <p>My <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby/blob/master/solutions/14-reindeer-races.rb">solution to Day 14</a> was the first problem I solved using Ruby classes (and looking back at my hastily written code, I realize that the methods <code>find_winner</code> and <code>find_leaders</code> should probably be converted to class methods). I also used classes on the following two days as well as for two of the most engaging problems in the entire sequence: Days 21 and 22. Both of these problems required first simulating and then optimizing a battle of the type that’s usually found in <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">role-playing games</a>.</p>

    <p>If we consider the time it took to fill the highly competitive Advent to Code leaderboard as an indicator of a problem’s difficulty, then <a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/22">Day 22</a> was the hardest day by a considerable margin as it took about 3 hours for the 100 leaderboard spots to be filled (as opposed to 20-30 minutes on an average day). As such, though Day 22 beckons to my typing fingers like a siren’s song (or a bad mixed metaphor), for all of our sakes I have chosen to analyze in this post the similar, but simpler Day 21 problem instead.</p>

    <h2>Advent of Code, Day 21 &ndash; The Problem</h2>

    <p>The scenario for this challenge (full details <a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/21">here</a>) is vaguely reminiscent of one of the <a href="../images/ff_box.jpg">seminal games</a> of my youth. The randomness of turn order and damage dealt is absent, but the basic concept of a hero possessing hit points and stat-boosting equipment fighting against an evil boss (who also has hit points and attack/defense stats) is the same. Simulating the rules given for this fight (how attack and defense works) is the programmer’s first battle.</p>

    <p>The second (and more interesting) battle is to figure out what combination of equipment (weapon, optional armor, and up to two optional rings) allows the hero to win the fight while spending the least amount of gold. In comparison to the complexities inherent in the follow-up challenge on Day 22, this puzzle is rather straightforward as there are no convoluted restrictions present and only a finite number of equipment combinations possible, a number low enough to be processed in mere microseconds. Still, there is a bit of programming to be done and design decisions to be made.</p>
