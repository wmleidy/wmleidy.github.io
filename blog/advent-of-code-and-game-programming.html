      <h1>Object-Oriented Game Programming (Advent of Code, Day 21)</h1>

    <p>My fourth and final post in my <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> series is devoted to two topics that I very much enjoy writing about: games and <a href="my-introduction-to-object-oriented-design.html">object-oriented programming</a>. As Advent of Code progressed and the challenges became more complex, there was a definite tipping point (at least in my mind) when taking advantage of Ruby’s classes to program in an object-oriented fashion paid dividends both in terms of quickly finding a valid solution and in terms of code readability.</p>

    <p>My <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby/blob/master/solutions/14-reindeer-races.rb">solution to Day 14</a> was the first problem I solved using Ruby classes (and looking back at my hastily written code, I realize that the methods <code>find_winner</code> and <code>find_leaders</code> should be converted to class methods). I also used classes on the following two days as well as for arguably the two most engaging problems in the entire sequence: Days 21 and 22. Both of these problems required first simulating and then optimizing a battle of the type that’s usually found in <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">role-playing games</a>.</p>

    <p>If we consider the time it took to fill the highly competitive Advent to Code leaderboard as an indicator of a problem’s difficulty, then <a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/22">Day 22</a> was the hardest day by a considerable margin as it took about 3 hours for the 100 leaderboard spots to be filled (as opposed to 20-30 minutes on an average day). As such, though Day 22 beckons to my typing fingers like a siren’s song (or a bad mixed metaphor), for all of our sakes I have chosen in this post to analyze the similar, but simpler Day 21 problem instead.</p>
