      <h1>Advent of Code, Day 5 &ndash; Regexp in Ruby</h1>

    <p>Completing the New York Times crossword puzzle is a morning ritual for thousands of Americans. While I personally never partook in this ritual (the less time-intensive Jumble fit into my morning better), it was something I could definitely see myself doing if I could justify to myself the time required. So, when I found about Eric Wastl’s <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, which offered a new programming challenge daily for 25 days in December, it quickly became part of my morning (or sometimes late night) routine.</p>

    <p>There was a lot to like about Advent of Code. First, most of the problems were of just the right complexity&mdash;20-40 minutes on average to come up with a working solution, but engaging enough to really require one to think. Second, there was a very nice variety of problem types, some math-based, some that were best solved using advanced data structures, some that allowed a Rubyist to delve deeply into infrequently used features of the language, and some that lent themselves to object-oriented programming. Third, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">reddit community</a> was a great resource for seeing how other programmers approached the problem and implemented their solutions in a range of different languages.</p>

    <p>As Advent of Code occupied a lot of my mental energy in December (deepening my knowledge of writing tests for Rails was the other thing I focused on this month), I am going to use a few of my favorite solutions as jumping off points for a series of short technical blogs. (The rest of my Advent of Code solutions can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby">GitHub repo</a>.) My first post covers regular expressions in Ruby, and is directed toward those without a lot of experience using Regex.</p>

    <section>
    <h2>Intro to Regexp in Ruby</h2>

    <p>Regular expressions, commonly called “Regex” in programming vernacular (or sometimes “Regexp,” as it exists in the Ruby language), provide a convenient way to locate matching patterns within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">string</a>. Need to validate that something is an email address or a phone number? Regex is your friend.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly (but perhaps not so surprisingly those who know Ruby fairly well), a regular expression in Ruby is an object, and an instance of the <code>Regexp</code> class can be conveniently created by placing the pattern to be matched between two forward slashes. For example, the regular expression <code>/aa/</code> would generate matches in the strings <code>"aardvark"</code> and <code>"naan"</code> (but very few other English words).</p>

    <p>To look for a pattern match, you obviously need two things&mdash;a pattern and a string. Once you have these two things, there are three main Ruby methods that can be called:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>#match</code> &ndash; <code>"devushka".match(/dev/)</code> would return a special <code>MatchData</code> object (<code>&lt;MatchData "dev"&gt;</code>)that behaves similarly to an array; <code>"chlopak".match(/dev/)</code> returns <code>nil</code>
      <li><code>=~</code> &ndash;
