  		<h1>Some Thoughts on Teamwork and Avoiding Conflicts</h1>
			<p class="date">August 8, 2015</p>
  	</header>

  	<p>I have written previously on <a href="on-pair-programming.html">the centrality of pair programming</a> in Dev Bootcamp’s instructional model, and, building on that, I’d like to share a few of my thoughts on teamwork and conflict avoidance in general. Some studies have shown a significant portion of IT projects that fail do so not because of any lack of technical knowledge on the part of the team members, but rather due to a lack of communication or teamwork amongst the team members. Therefore, being able to work in a team / successfully manage a team is obviously an important trait for any programmer to have, especially those who work at firms that subscribe to <a html="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development</a>.</p>

  	<p>Most people’s mental image of a programmer is someone who sits alone in front of their computer all day and works diligently (or not so diligently) on the project that has come down from above. From my time in grad school, I know that the preconception of a humanities grad student is similar&mdash;that our work was highly individual and the only time we would collaborate would be when we get together to drink coffee.</p>

  	<p>Both of these clichéd characterizations are inaccurate. In the humanities, as in the practice of agile software development, the best work develops gradually through the process of open dialogue with one’s colleagues. Everyone has their own specific field of expertise and everyone brings slightly different ideas to the table. Being open to listening to these ideas and integrating them into one’s own work is how projects go from good to great.</p>

  	<p>I was part of several teaching teams during my time in academia&mdash;both as a junior member and as a team leader. There are certainly people with egos in every industry, and within the upper echelons of academia is no different, and probably a bit worse. This clash of egos can easily turn into a source of conflict, as I’ve witnessed firsthand. The competing priorities that each member of the teaching team must try to juggle (balancing teaching responsibilities with research, writing, publishing, advising, and administrative duties is a fact of daily existence within academia) is another frequent generator of friction.</p>

  	<p>The best teams I’ve been part of have all shared one characteristic&mdash;a leader who fosters an inclusive environment where everyone feels their opinions are valued and their abilities trusted, while, at the same time, knowing when to exert an egoless authority to ultimately steer the team in the same direction. This might sound like a bit like generic management speak, but I don’t think it is. Creating a truly inclusive environment where every team member feels valued and trusted is incredibly difficult to achieve, whether in a development team, a teaching team, or within a classroom for that matter. There’s definitely an art to it, equal parts performance, patience, and sagacity. From my experience in academia, I think regularly setting aside time for open dialogue amongst team memebers is one of the best methods for heading off conflict before even a hint of it develops. That’s why reading through the Agile manifesto and discovering that similar management techniques are gaining greater and greater hold in the world of software development was such a pleasant eye-opener for me.</p>
