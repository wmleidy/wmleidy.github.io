      <h1>The Graph Data Structure (Advent of Code, Day 9)</h1>
      <p class="date">December 31, 2015</p>
    </header>
    
    <p>One of the things I enjoyed most about <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> was how the nature of the problems led one to utilize language features and data structures that are only infrequently used in everyday web development tasks. I had spent a decent portion of the previous month bootstrapping my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, so it was rewarding to be able to look at a problem and say, “Hey, this seems like the perfect place to use a graph.”</p>

    <p>Graphs (the data structure, not the things that Excel struggles to generate correctly) will be the topic of this post, the second in a series of posts that use Advent of Code as an entrée to explore technical topics.</p>

    <section class="clearfix">
    <h2>What Are Graphs?</h2>

    <p>Like most modern programming languages, Ruby gives its users lots of built-in data structures, such as arrays, hashes, sets, and queues. So, why bother building a <code>Graph</code> class? That is to say, what makes graphs unique as a data structure?</p>

    <p><img src="../images/simple-graph.png" alt="Simple Graph" class="right medium" />In contrast to other data structures, where the main goal is convenient storage, searching, and sorting, and the connections between the elements are incidental (a byproduct of their sorted order or order of insertion), <strong>in graphs, the connections themselves encode the relevant information</strong>. This will become clearer with an example. To the right is a (very) simple map of Poland with four cities represented on it. These cities could be stored in an array, <code>["Warsaw", "Lublin", "Poznań", "Gdańsk"]</code>, but then we miss out on what’s important here&mdash;the distances and routes between the cities. The graph data structure optimizes the storage of such “connection-heavy” data.</p>

    <p>For my mini-graph, the connections represent kilometers by car between the cities. However, please note, that the connections can represent pretty much anything. For a travel or mapping site, these connections might also represent travel time, price, a quality of travel metric, and other things besides just distance. For a social networking site, the points might symbolize users, whereas a connection between two points encodes a friendship.</p>

    <h2>Graph Terminology</h2>

    <p>There are a plethora of terms that are commonly used for the points and lines on a graph. I personally prefer the terms <strong>vertices</strong> and <strong>edges</strong>, so I will use these terms below.</p>

    <p>Graphs can be <strong>weighted</strong> or <strong>unweighted</strong>. In a weighted graph, edges have a particular value associated with them. In an unweighted graph, the edge between any two points is merely present or absent. Graphs can also be <strong>directed</strong> or <strong>undirected</strong>. In a directed graph, the edge <em>A&rarr;B</em> might not necessarily be the same as the edge <em>B&rarr;A</em> (for road maps, think of cases like one-way roads or construction detours; for social networks like Twitter, think of unreciprocated followings). Obviously, in an undirected graph, <em>A&rarr;B</em> will always be the same as <em>B&rarr;A</em>.</p>

    <p>Now that our terminology has been defined, let’s explore how one might a <code>Graph</code> class in Ruby, while keeping in mind that what follows below is just one programmer’s first attempt at doing so.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Building a Graph Class</h2>

    <p>One of the most interesting decisions that needs to made when constructing a <code>Graph</code> class is choosing how to keep track of the data in the edges. To my knowledge, there are three different “canonical” ways to do this, each with its own pluses and minuses:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>matrix &ndash; a matrix <em>M</em> of size <em>n x n</em> can be built with the data at <em>M[x,y]</em> representing either the presence/absence of a connection (unweighted graphs) or the weight of such a connection (weighted graphs); if you’re old enough to remember these things called road altases, they generally contained matrices of distances between major cities</li>
      <li>array + linked lists &ndash; the array <em>A</em> holds all the vertices in order, while the value at <em>A[x]</em> holds a linked list that contains all the edges that originate at vertex <em>x</em>; best used for sparsely connected graphs</li>
      <li>pointer-based &ndash; each vertex has one or two associated arrays, one that holds pointers to all of the vertex’s neighbors (or <em>nil</em> if no connection is present) and, if necessary, another array containing all the weights</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In my <code>Graph</code> class, I opted to use a pointer-based model. I chose to optimize my implementation for graphs with “named” (string-based) vertices and edges that hold a numerical value. Here’s what my <code>Vertex</code> class and beginnings of my <code>Graph</code> class looks like:</p>

<code class="block"><pre>
class Vertex
  attr_accessor :name, :neighbors, :weights

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @neighbors = []
    @weights = []
  end
end

class Graph
  attr_accessor :vertices

  def initialize
    @vertices = []
  end

  def add_vertex(name)
    @vertices &lt;&lt; Vertex.new(name)
  end

  def find_vertex_by_name(name)
    vertices.each do |v|
      return v if v.name == name
    end
    nil
  end

  def count
    vertices.length
  end
end
</pre></code>

    <p>A graph is initialized with an empty array of vertices. Each vertex is instantiated with a name, an empty neighbors array, and an empty weights array. Because of my choice to optimize for working easily with named vertices, I have a method <code>#find_vertex_by_name</code> that can track down a vertex by, well, its name, which is used internally to allow for the convenient invocation of complex graph algorithms using the vertex names as parameters. The <code>#count</code> method is heavily used internally as well, as knowing the total number of vertices is essential for many of the graph algorithms.</p>

    <p>The ease of using vertex names for arguments for all the methods of the <code>Graph</code> does come with a cost&mdash;it is somewhat clunky and costly to convert the name to the proper index position in the graph’s <code>@vertices</code> instance variable. For example, here’s my <code>#add_edge</code> method, which defaults for use with unweighted and undirected graphs (it will create a matching pair of unweighted edges for <em>A&rarr;B</em> and <em>B&rarr;A</em>), but can made to create edges for weighted and/or directed graphs by including additional arguments:</p>

<code class="block"><pre>
class Graph
  # ...see above...

  def add_edge(start_name, end_name, weight = nil, undirected = true)
    from = vertices.index { |v| v.name == start_name }
    to   = vertices.index { |v| v.name == end_name }
    vertices[from].neighbors[to] = true
    vertices[from].weights[to] = weight if weight
    if undirected
      vertices[to].neighbors[from] = true
      vertices[to].weights[from] = weight if weight
    end
  end
end
</pre></code>

    <p>The first thing the method does is track down the index positions in the graph’s <code>@vertices</code> array corresponding to the names entered as first and second arguments. Then the neighbors array of the starting (“originating”) vertex is updated at the position of the ending vertex to <code>true</code>.</p>

    <p>How Ruby is programmed to handle arrays helps here. Say we’ve just added a ninth vertex ("Nine") and tenth vertex ("Ten") to a graph <code>g</code>. Should we want to add an undirected, unweighted edge between the two, it’s as simple as calling: <code>g.add_edge("Nine", "Ten")</code>. The <code>@neighbors</code> array of the ninth vertex will be updated to <code>[nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, true]</code>. When <code>true</code> is assigned to <code>@neighbors[9]</code> (corresponding to the tenth vertex of the graph as Ruby arrays are zero-based), the other array positions are automatically filled with <code>nil</code>. This indicates that the "Nine" vertex has an edge that runs to the tenth vertex, but no other edges.</p>

    <p>By default, the <code>#add_edge</code> method will also create an edge that runs in the reverse direction. This can be suppressed by including <code>false</code> as a fourth argument to turn the <code>undirected</code> flag off. Including a weight for the edge(s) created is as simple as including it as a third argument.</p>

    <h2>What Can We Do With Graphs? &ndash; An Overview</h2>

    <p>This blog post would grow to even more monstrous proportions if I were to describe in detail all the cool stuff it’s possible to do with graphs and analyze the methods I wrote to accomplish these things. Instead I’ll provide a barebones overview of the possibilities of graphs, and refer my reader to my GitHub account for <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby/blob/master/data-structures/graphs.rb">all the implementation details</a>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Traversal/Search &ndash; Graphs can be traversed (or searched) in either a breadth-first fashion (by using a queue) or a depth-first fashion (by using a stack)</li>
      <li>Shortest Path &ndash; The classic algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices was envisioned by legendary computer scientist <a href="http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/dijkstra_1053701.cfm">Edsger Dijkstra</a>; theoretically, this can be used for weighted graphs (e.g. to find the shortest distance) and for unweighted graphs too (e.g. to find the minimum number of degrees to Kevin Bacon)</li>
      <li>All Shortest Paths &ndash; If we’re interested in finding all the shortest distances between all the vertices on the graph, Floyd’s algorithm does so quicker (in O(n^3) time) than repeatingly calling Dijkstra’s algorithm</li>
      <li>Minimal Spanning Tree &ndash; To find the “minimal spanning tree” of an undirected graph, that is, a collection of connected edges with the minimum possible total weight, Prim’s algorithm is one such option</li>
      <li>Traveling Salesman Problem &ndash; Lastly, the famously difficult and theoretically important optimization problem, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Traveling Salesman Problem</a>, which tries to find the shortest route whereby a salesman can visit each “city” (vertex) exactly once and then return to his hometown, is best represented by using a graph</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advent of Code, Day 9 &ndash; The Problem</h2>

    <p>On the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/9">ninth day</a> of Advent of Code, the elves give Santa a list of new locations to visit that includes distances between every pair of locations, and the task of the programmer is to find the shortest route that would visit each and every location exactly once. That’s Part One. For Part Two of the problem, Santa, probably a bit drunk on eggnog, decides he’s going to show off and take the longest possible route between all the locations (while visiting each of them exactly once). The lack of concern he shows for his reindeer’s health is frightening, but I guess we can excuse it because Santa grew up in a different era.</p>

    <h2>Advent of Code, Day 9 &ndash; A Solution</h2>

    <p>Shortly after checking the <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby/blob/master/input/input9-distances.txt">input</a> I received, I realized that (a) my implementation of the <code>Graph</code> class, with its emphasis on names and distances, would be a perfect fit, and (b) the problem is basically a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), only the salesman need not return to his home base.</p>

    <p>In the original <code>Graph</code> class I wrote, there was a rather naïve, brute-force approach to the TSP that only worked effectively up until about 10 vertices (as the number of cities (<em>n</em>) grows, the possible routes grow at the same speed as <em>n!</em>). In order to adapt it for this problem, I would need to modify the code to account for a situation where returning to the origin is unnecessary. I accomplished this with an optional <code>return_to_origin</code> parameter, which defaults to <code>true</code> as in the standard TSP.</p>

    <p>I’ll now walk through my modified implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem:</p>

<code class="block"><pre>
class Graph
  # ...see above...

  def brute_force_tsp(return_to_origin = true)
    min_distance = 1.0/0.0
    best_path = nil
    paths = (0...count).to_a.permutation.to_a
</pre></code>

    <p>This is the setup. Set the minimum path distance to <code>Infinity</code>, the best path to <code>nil</code>, and generate each and every possible permutation of the range 0 to the total number of vertices minus one. The numbers in these permutations will refer to the indices in the <code>@vertices</code> array of the graph and represent the city-to-city path that the salesman (or Santa) will provisionally take.</p><br />

<code class="block"><pre>
    paths.each do |path|
      cumulative_distance = 0

      path[0..path.length - 2].each_with_index do |start_index, i|
        end_index = path[i + 1]
        if vertices[start_index].weights[end_index]
          cumulative_distance += vertices[start_index].weights[end_index]
        else
          cumulative_distance += 1.0/0.0
        end
      end
</pre></code>

      <p>For each path, the cumulative distance is calculated. For a given path, say <code>[3, 5, 2, 7, 6, 0, 1, 4]</code>, the permutation array is iterated through step-by-step until the last position is reached. In the first step in the above array, the salesman travels from the fourth city to the sixth city (Ruby arrays are zero based, of course). The appropriate <code>Vertex</code> is referenced from the graph’s <code>@vertices</code> instance variable and if that <code>Vertex</code>’s <code>@weights</code> array holds a numerical value at position <code>[5]</code>, then the value is added to the cumulative distance. If no edge exists between the cities, then that array position will hold <code>nil</code>, and thus the cumulative distance is set to <code>Infinity</code> as no valid path exists.</p><br />

<code class="block"><pre>
      if return_to_origin
        if vertices[path[-1]].weights[path[0]]
          cumulative_distance += vertices[path[-1]].weights[path[0]]
        else
          cumulative_distance += 1.0/0.0
        end
      end
</pre></code>

      <p>In a normal TSP algorithm, this wouldn’t be an <code>if</code> block&mdash;the cost to return “home” from the last city is always calculated and added to the total. However, in the Advent of Code problem, we want to be able to pass a <code>false</code> flag into the algorithm and bypass this step.</p><br />

<code class="block"><pre>
      if cumulative_distance &lt; min_distance
        min_distance = cumulative_distance
        best_path = path
      end
    end
</pre></code>

      <p>The end of the <code>each</code> loop. If the evaluated path’s cumulative distance is the shortest, then replace the value of the minimum distance and array representation of the best path.</p><br />

<code class="block"><pre>
    if return_to_origin
      puts "The shortest distance for a complete loop is #{min_distance}"
    else
      puts "The shortest route to visit each vertex exactly once is #{min_distance}"
    end
    puts humanize_tsp_route(best_path, return_to_origin)
    [min_distance, best_path]
  end
</pre></code>

      <p>Not strictly necessary, but the <code>#brute_force_tsp</code> method finishes by calling a private method <code>#humanize_tsp_route</code> that renders the city-to-city path easily readable for a humans, who are more adept at words than numbers.</p><br />

      <p>With the setup now in place, all that’s left to do is to create a graph containing the vertices and edges specified in the input data and then call <code>#brute_force_tsp</code> with the <code>return_to_origin</code> flag set to <code>false</code>. Using <a href="advent-of-code-and-ruby-regexp.html">Ruby’s Regexp</a>, it would possible to pull out as capture groups all the data we’re interested in; however, a sloppier but no less effective way to do this is to use <code>#split</code> on each line of the input (comments are interspersed):</p>

<code class="block"><pre>
def build_graph_io
  g = Graph.new
  places = []

  IO.foreach("../input/input9-distances.txt") do |line|
    data = line.split
    
    # if locations don't yet exist in graph, add it to graph and tracker array
    unless places.index(data[0])
      places &lt;&lt; data[0]
      g.add_vertex(data[0])
    end

    unless places.index(data[2])
      places &lt;&lt; data[2]
      g.add_vertex(data[2])
    end

    # now add edge to graph
    g.add_edge(data[0], data[2], data[4].to_i)
  end
  g
end
</pre></code>

    <p>Note that the <code>#add_edge</code> method defaults to undirected, so with each call to this method, not one, but two edges are added to graph, both of the same weight. Now that the graph can be built, the denouement is a simple two-liner, which could easily be uglified into a one-liner:</p>

<code class="block"><pre>
places = build_graph_io
places.brute_force_tsp(false)

# Output:
# The shortest route to visit each vertex exactly once is 117
# Faerun -> AlphaCentauri -> Tambi -> Snowdin -> Norrath -> Tristram -> Arbre -> Straylight
</pre></code>
    </section>

    <h2>Part Two and Final Observations</h2>

    <p>As this post is already waaaaaaay too long as it stands, I shall have mercy on you and shan’t torture you with a blow-by-blow explanation of the Part Two solution, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby/blob/master/solutions/9-minimum-distance.rb">here</a>. Basically, it’s just another tweak of the basic TSP algorithm, only this one tracks maximum distance (as written it will only work for fully connected graphs, i.e. a path exists between each and every city, which is fine because our input conforms to this criterion).</p>

    <p>Of course, it is fully possible to solve this problem without bothering to construct a graph. (This day’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3w192e/day_9_solutions/">solution thread</a> on the AoC subreddit has a ridiculously concise &ndash; and ridiculously hard to read &ndash; Ruby solution spanning only 7 lines.) But by recognizing common computational problems and then identifying which data structure lends itself best to solving them, it’s possible to leverage well-known, reusable algorithms and adapt them toward specific goals whether that’s modeling relations on an expansive social networking or achieving more mundane goals like helping Santa visit eight mythical lands as quickly and painlessly as possible.</p>
