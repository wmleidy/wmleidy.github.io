      <h1>The Graph Data Structure (Advent of Code, Day 9)</h1>
      <p class="date">December 31, 2015</p>

    <p>One of the things I enjoyed most about <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> was how the nature of the problems led one to utilize language features and data structures that are only infrequently used in everyday web development tasks. I had spent a decent portion of the previous month bootstrapping my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, so it was rewarding to be able to look at a problem and say, “Hey, this seems like the perfect place to use a graph.”</p>

    <p>Graphs (the data structure, not the things that Excel struggles to generate correctly) will be the topic of this post, the second in a series of posts that use Advent of Code as an entrée to explore technical topics.</p>

    <h2>What Are Graphs?</h2>

    <p>Like most modern programming languages, Ruby gives its users lots of built-in data structures, such as arrays, hashes, sets, and queues. So, why bother building a <code>Graph</code> class? That is to say, what makes graphs unique as a data structure?</p>

    <p><img src="../images/simple-graph.png" alt="Simple Graph" class="right medium" />In contrast to other data structures, where the main goal is convenient storage, searching, and sorting, and the connections between the elements are incidental (a byproduct of their sorted order or order of insertion), <strong>in graphs, the connections themselves encode the relevant information</strong>. This will become clearer with an example. To the right is a (very) simple map of Poland with four cities represented on it. These cities could be stored in an array, <code>["Warsaw", "Lublin", "Poznań", "Gdańsk"]</code>, but then we miss out on what’s important here&mdash;the distances and routes between the cities. The graph data structure optimizes the storage of such “connection-heavy” data.</p>

    <p>For my mini-graph, the connections represent kilometers by car between the cities. However, please note, that the connections can represent pretty much anything. For a travel or mapping site, these connections might also represent travel time, price, a quality of travel metric, and other things besides just distance. For a social networking site, the points might symbolize users, whereas a connection between two points encodes a friendship.</p>

    <h2>Graph Terminology</h2>

    <p>There are a plethora of terms that are commonly used for the points and lines on a graph. I personally prefer the terms <strong>vertices</strong> and <strong>edges</strong>, so I will use these terms below.</p>

    <p>Graphs can be “weighted” or ”unweighted.” In a weighted graph, edges have a particular value associated with them. In an unweighted graph, the edge between any two points is merely present or absent. Graphs can also be “directed” or ”undirected.” In a directed graph, the edge <em>A&rarr;B</em> might not necessarily be the same as the edge <em>B&rarr;A</em> (for road maps, think of cases like one-way roads or construction detours; for social networks like Twitter, think of unreciprocated followings). Obviously, in an undirected graph, <em>A&rarr;B</em> will always be the same as <em>B&rarr;A</em>.</p>

    <p>Now that our terminology has been defined, let’s explore how one might a <code>Graph</code> class in Ruby, while keeping in mind that what follows below is just one programmer’s first attempt at doing so.</p>

    <h2>Building a Graph Class</h2>

    <p>One of the most interesting decisions that needs to made when constructing a <code>Graph</code> class is choosing how to keep track of the data in the edges. There are three different canonical ways to do this, each with its own pluses and minuses:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>matrix &ndash; a matrix <em>M</em> of size <em>n x n</em> can be built with the data at <em>M[x,y]</em> representing either the presence/absence of a connection (unweighted graphs) or the weight of such a connection (weighted graphs); if you’re old enough to remember these things called road altases, they generally contained matrices of distances between major cities</li>
      <li>array + linked lists &ndash; the array <em>A</em> holds all the vertices in order, while the value at <em>A[x]</em> holds a linked list that contains all the edges that originate at vertex <em>x</em>; best used for sparsely connected graphs</li>
      <li>pointer-based &ndash; each vertex has one or two associated arrays, one that holds pointers to all of the vertex’s neighbors (or <em>nil</em> if no connection is present) and, if necessary, another array containing all the weights</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I chose to try a pointer-based model...not sure how well I did...insert code...</p>
