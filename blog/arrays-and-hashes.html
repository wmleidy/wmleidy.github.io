  			<h1>Ruby Data Structures 101: Arrays and Hashes</h1>
				<p class="date">June 28, 2015</p>
  		</header>
			
				<p>Handling collections of data efficiently is one of the most important things any general-purpose programming language should be able to do. Whether the collection of data is small or large, leveraging the power of a computer to process it sure beats doing everything by hand. Different programming languages provide different (though generally similar) tools for structuring data. <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> gives its users two powerful built-in data structures for handling collections of data: <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>hashes</strong>. This post presents a basic overview of both structures and examples of their proper use. Also, there will be two atrocious, cringe-worthy puns. You've been warned.</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Array of Hope</h2>

				<p><strong>Arrays</strong> in Ruby are used to represent any collection of objects, and in particular, any collection whose <em>order</em> is important. Let's say Bobby's pre-algebra teacher wants to store his five test grades for storage and computational purposes. Hopefully for Bobby's sake, his grades will look something like this:</p>

				<code>
				bobby_grades = [99, 94, 100, 97, 98]
				</code>

				<p>Now if Bobby's teacher wants to quickly access his star pupil's grade on the first test, it's as simple as typing:</p>

				<code>
				bobby_grades[0]<br />
				# Result: 99<br />
				# (As in many programming languages, counting in Ruby starts from 0.)
				</code>

				<p>And if the teacher wants to find Bobby's average grade, something like this would accomplish it:</p>

				<code>
				bobby_grades.inject(0) { |sum, x| sum + x}.fdiv(bobby_grades.length)<br />
				# Result: 97.6
				</code>

				<p>While this particular example of an array used a collection of integers, arrays in Ruby can take a collection of any type of object (strings, booleans, classes, other arrays) and even mix object type (though this is not usually recommended).</p>

				<h2>Making a Hash of It</h2>

				<p>In contrast to arrays, <strong>hashes</strong> in Ruby store <em>pairs</em> of data, and each pair consists of a <em>key</em> and <em>value</em>. A <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/972/972-h/972-h.htm">dictionary</a> is a classic example of a situation where a hash should be utilized:</p>

				<code>
				devils_dictionary = {<br />
				 "learning" => "The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious",<br />
				 "Mammon" => "The god of the world's leading religion"}
				</code>

				<p>Or say you're designing a video game and you want to assign attributes to your childhood hockey hero:</p>

				<code>
				joe_sakic = {"skating" => 95, "passing" => 97, "wrist_shot" => 99, "hair" => 72}
				</code>

				<p>With hashes, retrieving a stored value is done by referencing its key:</p>

				<code>
				joe_sakic["hair"]<br />
				# Result: 72
				</code>

				<p>In versions of Ruby up to and including 1.8.x, hashes were <em>unordered</em> collections, which represented another crucial distinction from arrays. In practice though, since values in hashes are generally accessed by their keys and not by a numerical index (as elements in arrays are), it's still feasible to think of arrays as more explicitly and obviously ordered than hashes.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>Use arrays for a collection of objects; use hashes for a collection of object pairs. Or, to give one final example:</p>

				<p>Array<br />
				<code>bad_puns = ["Array of hope", "Make a hash of it"]</code>
				</p>

				<p>Hash<br />
				<code>lameness_level = {"Array of hope" => 99, "Make a hash of it" => 92}</code>
				</p>
