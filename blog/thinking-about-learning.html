				<p>At the risk of sounding like an advertisement for Dev Bootcamp, I must say that one of things that has pleasantly surprised me about the program thus far is just how much conscious thinking about the learning process is foregrounded. I hope I'm not revealing any trade secrets when I mention that part of our initial preparation for the course was reading (a summary of) Carol Dweck's landmark study on how mindset impacts learning. I've long been an admirer of Dweck's concept of mindset, having first come across it in a workshop on pedagogical theory.</p>

				<p>In a nutshell, Dweck identifies two different types of mindset&mdash;<em>fixed mindset</em> and <em>growth mindset</em>. People with a fixed mindset believe that a person's intelligence is some kind of inherent, inherited, and innate property. That means when people with a fixed mindset initially fail to do a certain task, they take this as evidence that they "aren't smart enough" or "can't do math." The negative repercussions of such a mindset affect both high achievers and middle and lower quartile students alike. Because it is human to avoid things that make us feel inferior or inadequate, the belief that we're not "naturally" good at doing something can quickly transform into a genuine aversion to it. (I've come across so many students who say they "hate math" and inevitably this is coupled with a claim, often false by the way, that they "aren't good at math.") By way of contrast, people with a growth mindset believe that intelligence and skills can, well, grow, and are more inclined tolook at tasks as opportunities to learn and further develop their skills. For people with a growth mindset, the metric that holds the most importance is effort, as any hard work that's put into doing something serves as a stepping stone toward becoming better at it.</p>

				<p>Understanding Dweck's two different types of mindset was incredibly useful to me when I worked as a teacher and tutor. I still vividly remember teaching a class of freshmen at one of America's leading universities. Almost all of them arrived on campus having been patted on the head accompanied by the refrain of "Wow, you're so smart" for the last 12 years. This was their established positive feedback loop. Now, for the first time in their lives, many of them were facing a situation where they were merely middle-of-the-pack. Add to that the normal stresses of trying to adapt to life outside of the parents' nest, and it's easy to see just how psychologically terrifying attending an elite university can be. The way students reacted to this pressure varied widely&mdash;some would redouble their efforts to outcompete their peers, others would treat assignments with a pronounced show of insouciance (thereby avoiding any chance that their best effort would fail to yield an "A"), and still others would reassess their place in the universe and eventually begin to focus on their academic and personal development for its own sake rather than their standing in relation to others. Three different paths for three different worldviews: Darwinian, hipper-than-thou, and humble.</p>

				<p>I felt it was part of my job as an educator to help foster a growth mindset in my freshman students, particularly those who were somewhat shellshocked at the high level of their peers. While eradicating the growth mindset, which had been inculcated in them throughout their K-12 years, was well nigh impossible, moving the needle toward a growth mindset was an achievable goal. Whenever possible, I would try to surreptitiously nudge them toward thinking about their college years as a chance for intellectual growth and experimentation. For example, I would tell them an anecdote about how one time during my senior year of college I looked back at an essay I wrote during freshman year and was shocked at how ham-fisted it seemed to my older self. The progress I had made over three years, imperceivable to me during the slow step-by-step growth process, was staring me right in the face. Another example: whenever a student in a language class would ask me whether they needed to know something presented during class outside the core unit material, I would invariably reply, "No, it won't be on the test, but if you ever want to say X to someone in Russian in real life, you should probably know X." The goal of such statements was to subconsciously push students toward thinking about higher education not as an endless string of test scores, but as a space where personal growth and self-discovery occurs. The fact that Dev Bootcamp strives to create a similar atmosphere was one of the key factors that sold me on the program. Once I begin the on-site portion of the program, we'll see how successful I think they were in delivering on their promise.</p>

				<p>By all rights, this post should probably end here. But I can't help but wade into slightly controversial waters. So, let's get right to it: do I think there is such a thing as innate intelligence? Yes, I do. The human mind is incredibly malleable, but I think it is an exaggeration to claim that every mind has exactly the same potential at birth. After all, don't our genes decide thousands of other our characteristics? It would seem to somewhat absurd to propose that our genes don't have some degree of influence on mental characteristics as well. (I was cursed with the affliction of having two completely non-musical ears, an affliction I share with everyone else in my immediate family. On the other hand, my parents tell me that it was apparent from a very early age that I was blessed with a mind made for doing math and organizing vast amounts of information.) So, does this represent a counterargument of sorts to the growth mindset? Strangely enough, no. If anything, it is additional justification for it. If everyone just threw their hands into the air and gave up when someone else was naturally better than them at someone, it would be a very boring and depressing world indeed. And while I know that I'll never be as good of a musician as my multi-instrumentalist friend who can seemingly pick up any object and make it sing, by maintaining a growth mindset I don't let this interfere with my own enjoyment of playing music and striving to become incrementally better along the way. And isn't this what life is about?</p>
