      <h1>The Dev Bootcamp Onsite Experience: Part 3</h1>
      <p class="date">October 31, 2015</p>
    </header>

    <p>We were told going into the final three-week period that there would be a lot less hand-holding than there was in the <a href="on-dev-bootcamp-onsite-pt2.html">second phase</a>. And so it was. It was as if someone had told us, “Okay, we’ve given you the foundation, now go build your masterpieces.” This professionalization effort was definitely intentional, because at the conclusion of the program, we need to feel that we are fully-fledged web developers, (very) junior web developers to be sure, but web developers all the same.</p>

    <h2>Week 7 &ndash; Rails and Much, Much More</h2>

    <p>This week was an absolute whirlwind of new technologies, and I would probably rank it just behind Week 1 in terms of overall intensity. It started with building two relatively small Rails apps in two days, followed by a march of technologies&mdash;testing within Rails using RSpec, Capybara, and more; Object-Oriented JavaScript arranged in the classic MVC design pattern; Jasmine testing within JavaScript; jQuery UI; and, finally, our first JavaScript front-end framework, Backbone.js. In retrospect, just a little bit more hand-holding might have been nice. Learning on your own is good, but learning from experts is better.</p>

    <p>There were a couple of things I really enjoyed about this week:</p>

    <p>1) <strong>The return of algorithms</strong> &ndash; While not discounting the art and skill required to write good, clean, modular, and well-organized code, by the time you’re building your eighth (admittedly simple and small) website over two weeks, everything becomes somewhat repetitive. Rails tries to ameliorate this situation by providing generators to handle common tasks, but that just shifts the challenge to wiring everything together properly (integrating Ruby and JavaScript, getting this or that API to talk with the server properly, setting up the various parts of the testing suite, etc.). However, there were a few exercises this week that harkened back to Week 1, exercises that required deep, logical thought to break down a complex problem. Solving these gave me a real thrill.</p>

    <p>2) <strong>Front-end JavaScript frameworks</strong> &ndash; I’ve heard the following cliché regarding front-end JavaScript frameworks many times: “They’re not too bad to learn, after all, they have the same JavaScript at the core.” I strongly disagree. Learning a JavaScript framework is like learning an entirely new and relatively distant dialect of a language you already know. Sure, there is some overlap in vocabulary and syntactic rules, but there is also a fundamental difference in how the language is structured and how meaning gets made through its building blocks. Plus, there is the presence of plenty of specialized vocabulary that doesn’t really overlap with the standard language. And that’s why learning Backbone.js over a few days was so fun for me&mdash;not only because of the challenge of doing so, but also because the Backbone “dialect” reflects an entirely different understanding of the world in the same way that the worldview of a small, linguistically-united community is filtered through their language. This makes sense because Backbone, unlike JavaScript, was designed for one particular purpose: to modularize elements on a webpage to allow for effortless synchronization between themand maximally efficient development.</p>

    <h2>Week 8 &ndash; Client Project</h2>
    <p>Though I’ve labeled Week 8 as the “client project,” that is actually somewhat of a misnomer. We (me and two other students) received our assignment around 11 am on Monday and had to present it at 3 pm on Wednesday afternoon. Our assignment was basically to build a more modern-looking version of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com">this website</a>. This was a hell of a sprint, made more hellish by the fact that we somewhat foolishly decided to incorporate all of the “stretch” challenges into our initial design and chose to try out a front-end HTML/CSS framework (<a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure</a>) that none of us had ever used before.</p>

    <p>I felt our team dynamics were particularly strong during this project. We mapped out the work, split it into three slices (me: games/back-end, Alexis: users/back-end, Chris: design/front-end), and trusted each other to do a great job. And whenever someone got stuck, one of the other team members would jump in to provide a second set of eyes (and a second brain). Tuesday night was particularly epic; a true hackathon atmosphere developed between everyone who stayed past 9 pm that night. There was a giddy energy, many lines of code written (some of them were even good), and lots of unhealthy snacks consumed.</p>

    <p>Here is the fruit of our collective labor: <a href="https://dbc-gamenight.herokuapp.com">Gamenight</a>. I think it turned out quite well indeed considering the time constraints.
