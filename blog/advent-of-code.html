    <p>Completing the New York Times crossword puzzle is a morning ritual for thousands of Americans. While I personally never partook in this ritual (the less time-intensive Jumble fit into my morning better), it was something I could definitely see myself doing if I could justify to myself the time required. So, when I found about Eric Wastlâ€™s <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, which offered a new programming challenge daily for 25 days in December, it quickly became part of my morning (or sometimes late night) routine.</p>

    <p>There was a lot to like about Advent of Code. First, most of the problems were of just the right complexity&mdash;20-40 minutes on average to come up with a working solution, but engaging enough to really require one to think. Second, there was a very nice variety of problem types, some math-based, some that were best solved using advanced data structures, some Regex-based, and some that lend themselves to object-oriented programming. Third, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">reddit community</a> was a great resource for seeing how other programmers approached the problem and implemented their solution in a range of different languages.</p>

    <p>As Advent of Code occupied a lot of my mental energy in December (deepening my knowledge of writing tests for Rails was the other thing I focused on this month), in this post I am going to present a few of my favorite Advent of Code solutions. (The <a href="https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby">rest of my solutions</a> can be found in a GitHub repo.)</p>
