		<p>Well, you just might have found yourself one! Please read on to learn a little bit more about me...</p>

		<p>I started teaching myself web development languages&mdash;first HTML and CSS, followed by Ruby, SQL, and JavaScript&mdash;in February 2015 in order to scratch an itch. I had spent the previous ten years of my life training to be and then working as a language professional, and yet my knowledge of “21st-century languages” was practically non-existent. I had always had an interest in programming (I can still remember mucking about in BASIC on the ancient computers in the back of my middle school classroom), but up until recently fate had led me down a different path. After doubling majoring in physical chemistry and Russian during college, I chose to pursue my interest in the latter, a decision I do not at all regret. The process of earning a PhD in Slavic Languages and Literatures from Stanford University was incredibly intense intellectually, and along the way I met many preternaturally talented people and had plenty of unforgettable experiences.</p>

		<p>When I was considering making a career change in early 2015, web development was one of the very first ideas that sprang to mind. Not only would this field allow me to fuse together my natural aptitude for math and science with my love of languages, but also potentially give me the chance to work in the tech industry alongside some of the best and brightest minds in America. So, I tried out coding, enjoyed it immensely, and decided to take the next logical step and enroll in an intensive program to round out and formalize my education. Currently, I am a student in Dev Bootcamp Chicago’s 19-week immersive program.</p>

		 <p>The transition from natural languages to programming languages has been an interesting one for me. On the one hand, Russian and Polish contain tens of thousands of words, an extensive case system, and complicated syntax. The shear size of a human language and its rules (and exceptions to the rules) dwarfs any programming language. Furthermore, natural languages exist inside a big messy framework called “culture” where, as groundbreaking 20th-century philosophers have pointed out, every utterance is intimately interconnected with both past and future utterances. The scale is unthinkably immense. On the other hand, programming languages present their own challenges&mdash;getting from here to there efficiently often requires excellent logical and mathematical skills, while the task of modeling real-world objects within a programming language in a maximally effective manner requires a type of creativity very different than the one poets or authors exercise. In my mind, the thing that links together natural and programming languages is that they’re both incredibly fun to work with.</p>

If the paragraphs above have inspired you to read more of my writing, I maintain a weekly <a href="blog/index.html">blog</a>, which contains posts on technical topics as well as other thoughts of mine.
