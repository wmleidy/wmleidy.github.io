		<p>Well, you just might have found yourself one! If your curiosity has been piqued, please read on...</p>

		<p>I started teaching myself web development languages&mdash;first HTML and CSS, followed by Ruby, SQL, and JavaScript&mdash;in February 2015 in order to scratch an itch. I had spent the previous ten years of life training to be and then working as a language professional, and yet my knowledge of “21st-century languages” was practically non-existent. I had always had an interest in programming (I can still remember mucking about in BASIC on the ancient computers in the back of my middle school classroom), but up until this point fate had led me down a different path. After doubling majoring in physical chemistry and Russian during college, I chose to pursue my interest in the latter, a decision I do not regret one iota. The process of earning a PhD in Slavic Languages and Literatures from Stanford University was incredibly intense intellectually, and along the way, I met many preternaturally talented people and had countless unforgettable experiences.</p>

		<p>When I was looking to make a career change in early 2015, I immediately struck upon idea programming would be the perfect way. Not only talented people in field, but alo great way to fuse together natural aptitude at math/hard sciences and love of languages. Tried it out, enjoyed, formalized education. Approaching from lanaguges with 20,000 words with complicated syntax, programming seems "easy." Frameworks and cultures. Bakhtin and interconnections.</p>
