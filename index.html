		<p>Here is where I include a good solid paragraph about myself that's borderline pretentious and just a tad frivolous, but represents me fairly and is serious enough to potentially attract more clicks to other parts of the site. More content to come later.</p>

		<p>They'll be more white space here, trust me.</p>

		<p>There actually would have been content included on the original day of creation (June 21); however, there was a huge issue about getting the body text to start below the header content. I spent 2 hours or so trying all the tricks I knew--using a wrapper, converting my big absolutely positioned to a background in the header and trying to use this to define header size, hiding a similarly sized image behind the image I wanted (as I found out, hiding an image does not remove it from the workflow so this failed). I ended up coming up with a fairly novel solution--I created a separate div that begins directly below the nav bar (the big image and the tagline are absoluted into place, so they don't count in the webpage rendering workflow) with identical dimensions to that of the picture. That means the first real division starts about 40 pixels under the bottom edge of the picture. It should scale correctly too, as both the photo and the placeholder div are defined by percentages. I'm actually proud of coming up with this solution, but I'm sure it will break somehow, at which point I hope that I'll learn the "approved" way to handle this issue. Perhaps Lightboxing my header/nav bar would allow me to position the big image in the normal document rendering flow, obviating the need for a placeholder div.</p>
